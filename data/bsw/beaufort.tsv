Beaufort	description	speed_mps
0	Calm	Smoke rises vertically. The sea is mirror smooth.	0
1	Light Air	Direction of wind shown by smoke drift but not by vanes. Scale-like ripples on sea, no foam on wave crests.	0.514
2	Light Breeze	Wind felt on face, leaves rustle, ordinary vanes moved by wind. Short wavelets, glassy wave crests.	2.06
3	Gentle Breeze	Leaves and small twigs in constant motion, wind extends light flag	3.6
4	Moderate Breeze	Raises dust and loose paper, small branches moved. Fairy frequent whitecaps occur.	5.65
5	Fresh Breeze	Small trees in leaf begin to sway. Moderate waves, many white foam crests.	8.74
6	Strong Breeze	Large branches in motion, whistling heard in telegraph wires. Some spray on the sea surface.	11.3
7	Moderate (Near) gale	Whole trees in motion, inconvenience felt when walking into wind. Foam on waves blows on streaks.	14.4
8	Gale	Twigs broken of trees, generally impeded progress. Long streaks on foam appear on sea.	17.5
9	Strong gale	Straight structural damage, e.g. slates and chimney pots removed from the roofs. High waves, crest start to roll over.	21.1
10	Storm	Trees uprooted, considerable structural damage. Exceptionally high waves, visibility affected.	24.7
11	Violent Storm	Widespread damage	28.8
12	Hurricane	Air is filled with spray and foam.	32.9
